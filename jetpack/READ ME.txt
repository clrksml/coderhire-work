Thank you for purchasing Jet Pack.

/* Installing */
Drop the 'jetpack' folder into your garrysmod/addons folder.
Drop the 'VGUI' folder into your garrysmod/materials/ folder.
Now restart your server.
If your TTT folder or DarkRP folder aren't named 'terrortown' or 'darkrp' then this will not currently work.

/* How it works /*
USE key for directional 'move'
SPACE key for upwards 'hover'

/* Known Issue(s) */
Because of the limitation within garrys mod, the sound position of the jet pack isn't updated.
I have submitting a request to the official git hub for such a function to be added.
